Lost Art
========

"Lost Art" is a wrapper for a Python project called "MIDIUtil."  (So, you'll need to install MIDIUtil through Pip for this to work.)

This is a script that helps writing MIDI files (which I consider to be a lost art-- I loved MIDI files when they were popular).

These classes use Python 3.x, and I don't think they're compatible with Python 2.7.

There are some example scripts in the root directory that uses this.

game_maintheme.py is an original tune of mine.  You can listen to it on [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/qohpvs_D3Tk).

kefka.py demonstrates the ability to change from a major key to a harmonic minor key easily.  It can be heard [here](https://youtu.be/HzziqNqioU8).  Available keys are major, natural minor, harmonic minor, hexatonic blues, and heptatonic blues.

In a future version, I hope to be able to add swing tempos, but I might need to learn a little more music theory to get into the knitty-gritty of the math involved.

(Remember that MIDIs aren't like mp3s-- The files will likely sound different on your machine.)
