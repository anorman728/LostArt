Lost Art
========

"Lost Art" is a wrapper for a Python project called "MidiUtil."  (So, you'll need to install MidiUtil through Pip for this to work.)

This is a script that helps writing MIDI files (which I consider to be a lost art-- I loved MIDI files when they were popular).

These classes use Python 3.x, and I don't think they're compatible with Python 2.7.

As I write this README, there is one example script in the root directory that uses this (I've written several, but this is the only one that's both an original tune and complete).  You can listen to it on [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/qohpvs_D3Tk).

(Remember that MIDIs aren't like mp3s-- The files will likely sound different on your machine.)
